INGREDIENTS

(2) Large Handfuls of fresh Baby Spinach
(5) Cloves of Garlic
(2 - 3) ounces of Salted Butter (it's "to taste," so you get to choose)

PREPARATION

Thinly slice the garlic
Heat a large skillet or frying pan over Medium-Low Heat

COOK

Put the butter and garlic in the preheated frying pan, stirring so that the garlic gets fully covered with the melted butter
Once the heated garlic begins to heat up, the room begins to smell like garlic, and the butter is fully melted, add the spinach
Stir the spinach, garlic, and butter until the spinach is fully wilted

EAT
while it is hot

RECOMMENDATIONS
Place on top of a 12 oz. 1.5 inch-thick Rib-Eye Steak cooked Medium Rare and pour yourself a large Cabernet Sauvignon.  Enjoy.
